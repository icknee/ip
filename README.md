# Bird project

This is a project for a greenfield Java project. It's made with the _Duke_ template provided. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have `Java 17` or above installed in your Computer.  
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/icknee/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).  
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Bird.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar bird.jar` command to run the application.  
 If the setup is correct, you should see something like this as the output:  
  <pre>  
  Hello! I'm bird
         .-.  
        /'v'\  
       (/   \)  
      ='="="===<  
         |_|
 </pre>
